       | Blame Forge changelog |

   (V.1.2.0 Changes) (1.16.2/1.16.3 Minecraft)
   
    Detection of DynamicRegistry classloading:
• Will detect if a mod classloaded DynamicRegistry way too
  early and is killing all other mods in the registry. 
  The message will print a stacktrace to help narrow down
  which mod is registering things improperly.


   (V.1.1.0 Changes) (1.16.2 Minecraft)
   
    JSON file on world loading:
• When starting up a world and a broken JSON file is found, 
  this mod will now print the resourcelocation of the broken 
  JSON file so it can be found and corrected faster! 


   (V.1.0.4 Changes) (1.16.2 Minecraft)
   
    Major:
• Full release of working Blame that doesn't crash itself! Wooooo!!!
